2.  
 
Write a program which will find all such numbers which are divisible by 7 but are not a multiple of 5, between 2000 and 3200 (both included). The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line. 
 
 list =[]
for number in range(2000,3201):
    if(number%5!=0 and number%7 ==0):
            list.append(str(number))
print(",".join(list))


3.  
 
Write a Python program to accept the user's first and last name and then getting them printed in the the reverse order with a space between first name and last name. 
 
fn = input("Enter first name")
ln=input("Enter last name")
print(ln+" "+fn) 

4.  
 
Write a Python program to find the volume of a sphere with diameter 12 cm.  

 pi=3.14
volume = (4/3)*pi*(6**3)
print(volume)
Formula: V=4/3 * Ï€ * r 3 

Task 2:  
 
 
1.  
 
Write a program which accepts a sequence of comma-separated numbers from console and generate a list. 
 values = input("Input comma seprated numbers : ")
list1 = values.split(",")
 
2.  
 
Create the below pattern using nested for loop in Python.

 n=5;
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(i):
        print ('* ', end="")
    print("")

for i in range(n,0,-1):
    for j in range(i):
        print('* ', end="")
    print("")

3.  
 
Write a Python program to reverse a word after accepting the input from the user. 


 word = input("Input a word to reverse: ")

for char1 in range(len(word) - 1, -1, -1):
  print(word[char1],end="")
Sample Output: 
 
Input word: AcadGild 
 
Output: dilGdacA 

4.  
 
Write a Python Program to print the given string in the format specified in the sample output. 
 
WE, THE PEOPLE OF INDIA, having solemnly resolved to constitute India into a 
SOVEREIGN, SOCIALIST, SECULAR, DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC and to secure to all its citizens 
 
string = "WE, THE PEOPLE OF INDIA, having solemnly resolved to constitute {} India into a SOVEREIGN,{} SOCIALIST, SECULAR,{} DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC{}and to secure to all its citizens{}"
print(string.format('\n\t','!','\n\t','\n\t\t',''))

Sample Output: 
 
WE, THE PEOPLE OF INDIA,   having solemnly resolved to constitute India into a SOVEREIGN, !  SOCIALIST, SECULAR, DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC  
  and to secure to all its citizens
